Select a page to be a custom archive for your post types.

== Description ==

Custom Archives lets you set the page of your choice as the archive page to any custom post type that uses archives. This provides you with flexibility allowing you to use a page with a custom template selected to display something different.

= Developers =

There are lots of action and filter hooks available to extend the functionality of this plugin. If you'd like more information on how to use them, take a look at the plugin Wiki on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/danieltj27/Custom-Archives/wiki).

= Special Thanks =

Thank you to the team at Human Made which released [Page for post type](https://github.com/humanmade/page-for-post-type/) which was used as inspiration for building this plugin.

== Installation ==

You must have at least one custom post type to use this plugin.

1. Download, unzip and upload the package to your plugins directory.
2. Log into the dashboard and activate within the plugins page.
3. Go to Settings > Archives and configure your custom archive pages.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I have a custom archive page for posts? =

By default WordPress allows you to use a special page as a custom archive page for posts so you don't need to use this plugin.

= Why am I not seeing any options? =

You must have at least one custom post type regsitered on your site for this plugin to have any affect. If you don't, you cannot use this.

= What happens if I delete the page? =

If you delete a page that is a custom archive page, it will automatically remove the setting and will safely default back to the standard archive page.

= Can the archive use the page permalink instead? =

No, due to technical difficulties and user experience considerations; the custom archive page must use the original archive permalink.

= Can I use a page for multiple archives? =

No, this is not possible as the user is redirected to the original archive page and having multiple redirects would result in an error.

== Screenshots ==

1. The custom archive settings page within the dashboard.
2. Viewing the custom archive page in the page list table.
